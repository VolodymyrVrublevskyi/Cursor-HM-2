       <i>A human mission to Mars has been the subject of science fiction since the 1880s,
           and of aerospece engineering and scientific proposals
           <b>since the late 1940s.</b>
           Plans include landing on Mars for exploration at a minimum, with some considering exploring its moons Phobos and Deimos.
           Longterm proposals have includede sending settlers and starting terraforming of the planet.<i>

       <h3>Exploration of Mars</h3>
       <br>
       <i>The exploration of Mars has been a goal of national spase programs for decades.
          Conceptual work for mission thet would involve human explorers has been ongoing since the <b>1950s,</b>
          with planned mission typically being stated as taking place anywhere between 10 and 30 years from the time they are drafted. The list of <b>crewed</b> Mars mission plans shows the various mission proposalt that have been put forth by multiple organization and space agencies in this field of space exploration.
          Plans have varied from scientific expeditions, in whitch a small group would visit Mars for a period of a few weeks or year, to a continuous presence.
          Virtual visits to Mars, using haptic tehnologies, have also benn proposed.
          <big>In the 2010s,</big> numerous US, European, and Asian agencies were developing proposals for human mission to Mars. In fiction, 
          Mars is a frequent target of exploration and settlement in books, graphic novels, and films.</i>
